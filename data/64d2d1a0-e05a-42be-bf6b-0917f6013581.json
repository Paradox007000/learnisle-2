{"text":"\n\n \n Java – Quick Notes \n \n✅ What is Java? \n \nJava is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language. \nDeveloped by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995. \nFollows the principle: “Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)”. \n \n \n✅ Features of Java \nPlatform Independent (runs on any OS with JVM) \nObject-Oriented \nSecure \nRobust \nMultithreading \nPortable \nDistributed \nSimple & Easy to learn \n \n \n \n--- \n \n✅ Components of Java \n \nJVM – Java Virtual Machine (runs the program) \nJRE – Java Runtime Environment (provides libraries) \nJDK – Java Development Kit (compiler + tools) \n \n \n\n \n--- \n \n✅ Basic Structure of a Java Program \n \nclass Main { \n    public static void main(String[] args) { \n        System.out.println(\"Hello Java\"); \n    } \n} \n \n \n--- \n \n✅ Data Types \n \nPrimitive types: \nint, float, double, char, boolean, byte, short, long \n \nNon-primitive: \nString, Array, Class, Interface, etc. \n \n \n \n--- \n \n✅ OOP Concepts (Very Important) \n \n1. Encapsulation – Hiding data \n2. Inheritance – One class acquiring properties of another \n3. Polymorphism – Many forms (method overloading/overriding) \n\n4. Abstraction – Hiding implementation detailts \n--- \n \n✅ Keywords (Common) \n \nclass, public, static, void, final, this, super, extends, implements, try, catch \n \n \n \n--- \n \n✅ Exception Handling \nHandled using: \ntry { \n   // risky code \n} catch(Exception e) { \n   // handle error \n} \n \n \n--- \n \n✅ Java Applications \n \nUsed in: \n \nWeb apps \nMobile apps (Android) \nDesktop apps \nBanking systems \nGamesCloud computing \n\n "}

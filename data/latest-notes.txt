# Study Notes: Software Project Management

## 1. Project Scheduling
Project scheduling is the process of creating a roadmap to track tasks, deadlines, and resource allocation within a project.

*   **Purpose:** To communicate what needs to be done, who will do it, and the timeframe for completion.
*   **Key Components:** Start/end dates, milestones, tasks, resources (people/equipment), and task dependencies.

### The Project Scheduling Process
1.  **Identify Activities:** Break the project into small, manageable tasks with clear start and end points (e.g., coding, testing).
2.  **Identify Activity Dependencies:** Determine the order of tasks.
    *   **Finish-to-Start (FS):** Task B starts after Task A finishes.
    *   **Start-to-Start (SS):** Task B starts when Task A starts.
    *   **Finish-to-Finish (FF):** Task B finishes when Task A finishes.
    *   **Start-to-Finish (SF):** Task B finishes when Task A starts (Rare).
3.  **Allocate Resources:** Assign tools, budget, and materials to ensure they are available when needed.
4.  **Create Project Charts:** Use visual tools like **Gantt Charts** (timelines) or **PERT/CPM Charts** (dependencies/critical path).
5.  **Allocate People:** Assign team members based on skills while avoiding overloading individuals.

## 2. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
WBS is a "Top-Down" hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, independent modules and activities.

*   **Features:**
    *   Breaks complex projects into manageable parts.
    *   Follows a tree-like structure.
    *   Supports scheduling, resource allocation, and cost estimation.
*   **The Four Levels:**
    *   **Level 1: Project Goal** (The entire system).
    *   **Level 2: Major Modules** (e.g., Design, Implementation, Testing).
    *   **Level 3: Sub-Modules/Activities** (e.g., Database design, Unit testing).
    *   **Level 4: Work Packages** (Smallest tasks assigned to individuals).

## 3. Activity Networks
An Activity Network is a graph showing how tasks relate to each other in a logical sequence.

*   **AON (Activity on Node):** Activities are shown as circles/ovals (nodes) and sequence is shown by arrows.
*   **AOA (Activity on Arrow):** Activities are represented by arrows, while nodes represent the start or end "events" of those activities.

## 4. Project Tracking & Tools
Project tracking monitors progress to ensure the project stays on schedule, under budget, and meets quality standards.

### Gantt Chart (Timeline Chart)
*   **Definition:** A visual tool using horizontal bars to show task duration and schedule.
*   **Goal:** To visualize overlaps, dependencies, and the sequence of events.
*   **Output:** Often leads to the creation of "project tables" listing start/end dates for every task.

### Earned Value Analysis (EVA)
EVA is a technique to measure project health by integrating cost, schedule, and scope.

*   **Core Metrics:**
    *   **Planned Value (PV):** Budgeted cost for work *planned* to be done by a specific date.
    *   **Earned Value (EV):** Budgeted cost for work *actually completed* by that date.
    *   **Actual Cost (AC):** The real money spent to complete the work so far.
*   **Performance Indicators:**
    *   **Schedule Variance (SV):** (EV - PV). Negative means behind schedule.
    *   **Cost Variance (CV):** (EV - AC). Negative means over budget.
    *   **SPI/CPI:** If the performance index is less than 1, the project is behind schedule (SPI) or over budget (CPI).

# Study Notes: Software Testing Tools and Measurement

## 1. Manual Testing
**Short Explanation:** Manual testing is the process where a human tester checks software without automation tools to find defects, acting like an end-user to verify features step-by-step.

### The Manual Testing Process (8 Steps)
*   **Requirement Analysis:** Understanding what needs to be tested based on software requirements.
*   **Test Planning:** Deciding the strategy, scope, resources, and timeline.
*   **Test Case Design:** Writing test cases, scenarios, and preparing data.
*   **Test Environment Setup:** Setting up necessary hardware and software.
*   **Test Execution:** Manually running tests and marking them as Pass or Fail.
*   **Defect Reporting:** Logging found bugs and assigning severity/priority.
*   **Re-testing & Regression Testing:** Checking fixed bugs and ensuring existing features still work.
*   **Test Closure:** Preparing summary reports and signing off.

### Limitations of Manual Testing
*   **Time-consuming:** Especially for large applications.
*   **Repetitive tasks:** Inefficient for tests like regression testing.
*   **Accuracy issues:** Prone to human error.
*   **Performance limitations:** Cannot accurately measure load or stress.
*   **High manpower:** Requires more testers, increasing project costs.

## 2. Automation Testing
**Short Explanation:** This technique uses specialized tools (like Selenium or JUnit) and scripts to run test cases automatically, comparing actual results with expected results.

### Benefits & Importance
*   **Speed:** Much faster than manual execution.
*   **Reliability:** Consistent results with fewer human errors.
*   **Reusability:** Scripts can be used multiple times and run 24/7.
*   **Efficiency:** Increases the cycle of execution while saving long-term time and cost.

### The Automation Process
1.  **Feasibility Analysis:** Decide if automation is suitable (check ROI and stability).
2.  **Tool Selection:** Choose a tool based on technology, budget, and team skill.
3.  **Framework Evaluation:** Select a framework (Data-driven, Keyword-driven, or Hybrid).
4.  **Proof of Concept (POC):** Create a small sample to verify tool capability.
5.  **Develop Framework:** Build the structure for scripts and reporting.
6.  **Develop & Execute Scripts:** Write scripts, run them, and analyze failures.

## 3. Comparison: Manual vs. Automation

| Aspect | Manual Testing | Automation Testing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Execution** | Performed by a human. | Executed via tools and scripts. |
| **Speed** | Slower. | Significantly faster. |
| **Accuracy** | Prone to human error. | Highly consistent and reliable. |
| **Cost** | Lower initial cost; higher long-term cost. | Higher initial cost; lower long-term cost. |
| **Programming** | No coding knowledge required. | Requires knowledge of languages (Java, Python, etc.). |
| **Best Use Case** | UI/UX and Exploratory testing. | Regression and Performance testing. |

## 4. Software Testing Tools Categories
*   **Manual/Management:** JIRA, Bugzilla, TestLink.
*   **Automation (Functional):** Selenium, UFT (QTP), Cypress.
*   **Performance (Load/Stress):** JMeter, LoadRunner.
*   **Mobile:** Appium, Espresso.
*   **API:** Postman, SoapUI.
*   **Security:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.

## 5. Selecting the Right Tool
**Short Explanation:** Choosing a tool is critical because tools can be expensive, require specific training, or may not support all platforms.

### Key Selection Criteria
*   **Meeting Requirements:** Does it support the project goals and required test types?
*   **Technology Expectations:** Is it compatible with the project's OS, browsers, and languages?
*   **Training and Skill:** Can the team learn it easily? Is there good documentation?
*   **Management Aspects:** What is the cost, licensing, and expected Return on Investment (ROI)?

## 6. Selenium Deep Dive
**Short Explanation:** An open-source suite used specifically for automating web applications across different browsers and platforms.

### Key Features
*   **Open Source:** Free to use with no licensing costs.
*   **Multi-Language:** Supports Java, Python, C#, and Ruby.
*   **Cross-Browser:** Works on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.
*   **Platform Independent:** Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
*   **Parallel Execution:** Can run multiple tests at once to save time.

### Components of Selenium
*   **Selenium IDE:** A record-and-playback tool for beginners to create quick scripts.
*   **Selenium WebDriver:** The core component for complex, fast, and reliable automation using code.
*   **Selenium Grid:** Used to run tests on multiple machines and browsers simultaneously.

# Study Notes: Software Project Management

## 1. Project Scheduling
Project scheduling is the process of creating a roadmap to track tasks, deadlines, and resources within a project. It serves as a communication tool to show what needs to be done, who will do it, and the timeframe for completion.

**Key Components:**
*   **Tasks and Milestones:** Specific activities and major progress points.
*   **Resources:** People, equipment, and software tools required.
*   **Dependencies:** How tasks rely on one another.
*   **Timeframes:** Start and end dates for every activity.

## 2. The Project Scheduling Process
This process organizes work into separate, manageable tasks through five main steps:

1.  **Identify Activities:** Break the project down into smaller tasks (e.g., requirements gathering, coding, testing).
2.  **Identify Activity Dependencies:** Determine the order of tasks.
    *   **Finish-to-Start (FS):** Task B starts only after Task A finishes.
    *   **Start-to-Start (SS):** Task B starts when Task A starts.
    *   **Finish-to-Finish (FF):** Task B finishes when Task A finishes.
    *   **Start-to-Finish (SF):** Task B finishes when Task A starts (rare).
3.  **Allocate Resources:** Assign equipment, tools, and budget to each activity.
4.  **Create Project Charts:** Use visual tools like **Gantt Charts** (timelines) or **PERT/CPM Charts** (dependencies and critical paths).
5.  **Allocate People:** Assign team members to tasks based on their skills without overloading them.

## 3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
A WBS is a hierarchical, "Top-Down" decomposition of a project into smaller, more manageable pieces. It starts with the project name at the root and breaks down into "leaf" levels that are independent and undividable.

**The Four Levels of WBS:**
*   **Level 1 – Project Goal:** The entire software system (e.g., Library Management System).
*   **Level 2 – Major Modules:** High-level deliverables like Design, Implementation, or Testing.
*   **Level 3 – Sub-Modules:** Specific activities like "Database Design" or "Unit Testing."
*   **Level 4 – Work Packages:** The smallest manageable tasks assigned to specific individuals.

## 4. Activity Networks
An activity network is a graph showing the logical sequence of tasks and their dependencies. There are two primary methods:
*   **Activity on Nodes (AON):** Activities are represented by circles (nodes), and arrows show the sequence.
*   **Activity on Arrows (AOA):** Activities are represented by arrows, while nodes represent the start or end "events" of those activities.

## 5. Project Tracking and Tools
Tracking involves monitoring progress to ensure the project stays on schedule, within budget, and meets quality standards.

### Timeline/Gantt Charts
*   **Definition:** A visual chart using horizontal bars to show the start and end dates of tasks against a timeline.
*   **Purpose:** To emphasize the scope of individual tasks, identify overlaps, and track progress over time.

### Earned Value Analysis (EVA)
EVA is a technique used to measure a project’s health by integrating cost, schedule, and scope. 

**Core Metrics:**
*   **Planned Value (PV):** Budgeted cost of work that *should* have been done by now.
*   **Earned Value (EV):** Budgeted cost of work *actually* completed.
*   **Actual Cost (AC):** Real money spent to complete the work so far.

**Performance Indicators:**
*   **Schedule Variance (SV = EV - PV):** A negative number means the project is behind schedule.
*   **Cost Variance (CV = EV - AC):** A negative number means the project is over budget.
*   **Performance Indexes (SPI & CPI):** A value less than 1.0 indicates the project is behind schedule or over budget.

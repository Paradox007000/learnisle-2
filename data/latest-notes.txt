Focusing on Chapter 5: Software Project Management, here are your study notes, bullet points, and simplified explanations based on the text provided.

### **1. Project Scheduling**
**Short Explanation:** This is the process of deciding how to organize project work into separate tasks and determining when and how they will be executed. It acts as a map for tasks, deadlines, and resources.

*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Timeline:** Start and end dates.
    *   **Milestones:** Major points of progress.
    *   **Resources:** People, equipment, and tools needed.
    *   **Dependencies:** How tasks rely on each other.

**The 5-Step Scheduling Process:**
1.  **Identify Activities:** Break the project into small, manageable tasks (e.g., coding, testing).
2.  **Identify Activity Dependencies:** Determine the order of tasks.
3.  **Allocate Resources:** Assign tools, software, and budget to each activity.
4.  **Create Project Charts:** Use visual tools like Gantt or PERT/CPM charts to see the workflow.
5.  **Allocate People:** Assign team members to tasks based on their skills without overloading them.

### **2. Task Dependencies**
**Short Explanation:** In project management, some tasks cannot start or finish until others do.

*   **Finish-to-Start (FS):** Task B starts only after Task A is finished (Most common).
*   **Start-to-Start (SS):** Task B starts at the same time Task A starts.
*   **Finish-to-Finish (FF):** Task B can only finish when Task A is finished.
*   **Start-to-Finish (SF):** Task B can only finish when Task A starts (Rare).

### **3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
**Short Explanation:** A hierarchical "tree" structure that breaks a complex project down into smaller, independent parts. It follows a **Top-Down approach**.

*   **Levels of WBS:**
    *   **Level 1 (Goal):** The complete system (e.g., Library Management System).
    *   **Level 2 (Major Modules):** Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing.
    *   **Level 3 (Activities):** Sub-tasks (e.g., Database design, Unit testing).
    *   **Level 4 (Work Packages):** The smallest manageable task assigned to an individual.

### **4. Activity Networks**
**Short Explanation:** A visual graph showing the logical sequence of tasks and their relationships.

*   **Activity on Nodes (AON):** Activities are shown as circles or ovals. Arrows show the sequence.
*   **Activity on Arrows (AOA):** Activities are shown as arrows. Nodes represent the start or end of an event.

### **5. Project Tracking Tools**
**Short Explanation:** Monitoring and controlling the project to ensure it stays on schedule, within budget, and meets quality standards.

*   **Gantt Chart (Timeline Chart):**
    *   Shows tasks as horizontal bars against a timeline.
    *   Visualizes start dates, end dates, and overlaps.
    *   Emphasizes the scope of individual tasks.

*   **Earned Value Analysis (EVA):**
    *   A technique to measure project health by integrating cost, schedule, and scope.
    *   **PV (Planned Value):** Budgeted cost for work *planned* to be done.
    *   **EV (Earned Value):** Budgeted cost for work *actually completed*.
    *   **AC (Actual Cost):** Real money spent so far.

**How to read EVA Results:**
*   **Schedule Variance (SV = EV - PV):** If negative, you are behind schedule.
*   **Cost Variance (CV = EV - AC):** If negative, you are over budget.
*   **Performance Indexes (SPI & CPI):** If the value is **less than 1**, the project is behind schedule or over budget.

These devices are capable of \nsensing  real-world  parameters,  processing  the  collected  data,  and  sharing  it  over \ncommunication networks to perform intelligent actions. IoT plays an important role in modern \napplications such as healthcare, smart agriculture, smart homes, and smart cities. \n \nIoT protocols are a set of communication rules that allow devices to exchange data efficiently \nand reliably. Since IoT systems involve a large number of heterogeneous devices and networks, \na layered architecture is used to manage complexity and ensure smooth data flow. Each layer \nin the architecture has a specific responsibility and uses suitable protocols for communication. \nThis case study explains the IoT protocol architecture using four layers, along with the \nprotocols used in each layer, through the example of a Smart Healthcare Monitoring System. \n \nCase Study Description: Smart Healthcare Monitoring System \nHealthcare relies heavily on timely monitoring of patient vital signs such as heart rate, blood \npressure, body temperature, and glucose levels. Traditional healthcare monitoring methods \noften  require  manual  measurement  and  frequent  hospital  visits,  which  can  be  time-\nconsuming and inefficient. The Smart Healthcare Monitoring System uses IoT technology to \ncontinuously monitor patients’ health conditions. \n \nIn this system, wearable sensors and devices are used to collect real-time patient data. The \ncollected information is transmitted to a central healthcare system for analysis. Based on the \nanalysis, alerts are sent to doctors or caregivers if any abnormality is detected. This improves \npatient care, reduces emergencies, and allows for proactive health management. \n \n \nFour-Layer IoT Architecture and Protocols Used \n \n1.Perception Layer (Device Layer) \n\nRole \nThe  perception  layer  is  responsible  for  sensing  and  collecting  data  from  the  physical \nenvironment. It acts as the interface between the real world and the IoT system. \n \nDevices Used- \nWearable health sensors (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature) \nGlucose monitoring devices \nPulse oximeters \nActuators (e.g., insulin pumps) \n \nProtocols Used- \n RFID \n ZigBee \n \nWorking \nSensors and devices continuously monitor patient vital signs and convert the physical data \ninto digital signals. If any reading crosses a critical threshold (e.g., high blood pressure), the \nsensor detects it and prepares the data for transmission to the transport layer. \n \n \n2. Transport Layer (Network Layer) \nRole \nThe transport layer is responsible for transmitting data from the perception layer to the \nprocessing layer through communication networks. \n \nProtocols Used \n Wi-Fi \n IPv6 \n 6LoWPAN \n \n \n\nWorking \nPatient  data  is  transmitted  wirelessly  from  wearable  devices  to  a  nearby  gateway  or \nsmartphone. The gateway then forwards the data to cloud servers using internet-based \nprotocols. This layer ensures reliable, secure, and timely transmission of sensitive health \ninformation. \n \n3. Processing Layer (Middleware Layer) \nRole \nThe processing layer stores, processes, and analyzes the data received from the transport \nlayer. It acts as the decision-making unit of the IoT system. \n \nProtocols Used \n MQTT \n HTTP \n \nWorking \nThe cloud system receives patient data and stores it securely. Analytical tools process the data \nto detect any abnormalities or trends. If a patient’s vital signs fall outside normal ranges, the \nsystem generates an alert to notify the doctor or caregiver. \n \n \n4. Application Layer \nRole \nThe application layer provides services to end users and enables monitoring and control of \nthe IoT system. \n \nProtocols Used \n HTTP \n HTTPS \n \nWorking \n\nDoctors  and  caregivers  access  patient  data  through  mobile  or  web  applications.  The \napplication  displays  real-time  health  information,  alerts,  and  historical  trends.  Control \ncommands, such as adjusting a connected insulin pump, can also be sent through the \napplication. \n \n \nAdvantages of Four-Layer IoT Architecture \n \nClear separation of functions \n \nBetter scalability and flexibility \n \nEfficient communication and data processing \n \nReal-time patient monitoring and automated alerts \n \nReduced manual intervention and faster response to health emergencies \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nThis case study on IoT protocol explains the implementation of a four-layer architecture in a \nSmart Healthcare Monitoring System. Each layer performs a specific function and uses \nappropriate  protocols  for  sensing,  communication,  processing,  and  application-level \ninteraction. The layered approach improves system efficiency, reliability, and automation, \nmaking IoT technology highly suitable for modern healthcare applications "}
